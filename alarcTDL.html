                ALARC™-TDL allows optimization of furnace operations by analyzing the off-gas composition. By measuring the CO and CO<sub>2</sub>, it is possible to optimize consumption of oxygen, fuel and carbon. Typical burner systems and oxygen injection technologies operate using recipes. If furnace conditions change, there is no feed-back and fuel and/or oxygen could be introduced into the furnace without any benefits.

                ALARC™-TDL reduces operating costs per ton and maximizes production by monitoring and optimally controlling the flow of gasses to the different burners/injectors.

               During scrap melt in, CO and CO<sub>2</sub> readings are used by ACI to optimize natural gas, oxygen, and injection carbon rates. By optimizing the gases during the whole process, typically gas savings are achieved and/or production increase is established. The overall goal is a decrease in production cost per ton.
