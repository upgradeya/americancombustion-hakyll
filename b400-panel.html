               The newest EAF sidewall panel technology from ACI is the Basilisk™ B-400 panel.  With the compact and robust design of the BASILISK™ B-400 panel design you gain the ability to install the panel close enough to the steel bath for good decarburization but minimize the distance the panel protrudes into the furnace.  With a lower profile in the EAF, there is less chance of damaging the panel during the charging process.  The small size of the panel also allows for easy installation and removal from the furnace sidewalls.

            </p>

                The BASILISK™ B-400 panel is equipped with a replaceable carbon injection pipe located right below the injector centerline. This allows for carbon to be entrained and driven into the slag by highly aspirating supersonic stream.

               The panel is also supplied with mounting plate.
