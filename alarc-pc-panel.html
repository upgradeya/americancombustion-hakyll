              The ALARC™-PC panel is a compact and durable panel mounted in the sidewall of the EAF to capture the chemical energy available in the process gases evolving from the bath.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its design enables it to be mounted in the sidewall at a lower elevation than most post-combustion systems.

          </p>
          <p>
            This low elevation increases the time that post-combustion energy can be transferred to the scrap because scrap located on the walls at the brick line usually takes the longest time to melt.
