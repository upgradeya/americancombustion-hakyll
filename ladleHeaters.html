          <p>Ladle heating, today, is almost as critical to the steelmaking operation as any other process. The key
          objective of ladle heating is to avoid, or better limit, the metal temperature fall due to the metal
          transfer into a ladle. Today, with the new techniques of ladle metallurgy (degassing, desulphurization
          etc), high temperatures of preheating are frequently required. The energy cost of ladle heating has
          consequently grown and, in the same time, more attention is given to it.</p>

          <p>The evolution in refractory materials allows the use of air-oxy- fuel burners, such as ACI's PyreTron
          burner, to realize the ladle preheating, with very good performances and with all the advantages related
          to oxy-combustion. Some of the main benefits of ACI’s PyreTron technology, which has been installed in
          over 140 ladle heating systems in the last 20 years, are following.</p>

          <h3>Cost saving</h3>

          <p>PyreTron’s air-oxy- burner technology gives the flexibility to run the burner according to fuel and O<sub>2</sub>
          costs. It can run with high O<sub>2</sub> participation when fuel costs are high and with high air participation when
          O<sub>2</sub> costs are high. So the customer has the flexibility to run their heater depending on market situation
          or fuel/ O<sub>2</sub> availability while also providing them the highest possible cost saving.</p>

          <h3>Fuel saving</h3>
          <p>PyreTron can achieve upto 60% fuel saving compared to air burners depending on ladle operation.</p>

          <h3>Longer refractory life</h3>
          <p>Since PyreTron has the flexibility to operate with varying O<sub>2</sub> participation, the customer can adjust the
          flame temperature according to operational needs such as high air participation while drying and high O<sub>2</sub>
          participation while holding. It provides them the most ideal flame temperature for their operation thus
          improving the ladle refractory life.</p>

          <h3>Increased reliability and lower maintenance</h3>
          <p>PyreTron burners are air cooled because of their design so need very little maintenance throughout
          their life. Some of our burners have been in ladle heating operation for over 20 years without any issues.</p>

          <h3>Reduction in heating time compared to air burners</h3>
          <p>The variable O<sub>2</sub> participation provides up to 30% reduction in heating time compared to conventional air
          burners.</p>
